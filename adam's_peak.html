       <p> If there’s one religious place in Sri Lanka visited by people belonging to any religion,
        ethnic group or cast, it is none other than Adam’s Peak or Sri Paadaya in Sinhala. 
        It is also called ‘Samanala Kanda’ (Butterfly Mountain) by Sri Lankans. The unique feature of this 
        place is that it has a footprint which Buddhists believe is that of Lord Buddha set during the His 
        visit to Sri Lanka.</p><br>
        <p>
        Hindu people also believe that the foot print belongs to Lord Shiva, and also Islam and Catholic
         devotees believe the same as the foot print of Adam. This peak is located in the Rathnapura 
         district and the height is about 7360 feet. This can be identified easily due to its uncommon 
         and specific shape of a cone.</p><br>
        <p>
        Generally the pilgrimage period to venerate this place is from December to April of the following year
        ins and unpredictable weather restrict the tedious hike to the peak during the remaining months which is 
        called “off season” during which period the animals are allowed to live peacefully in the peak wilderness
         among the wild flora. But, if you are adventurous and ready to take risk, this off season can be made use
         of for the great hike to the peak, since there is less people and more wild animals on this route to the
         peak. Since the hiking on the thousands of stone steps has to be done in the cold, humid weather, you
         are advised to be equipped with suitable clothing.</p><br>
        <p>
        According to the history, there are 6 entrances to access Adam’s peak. They are on Hatton Road, 
        Rathnapura road, Kuruvita Road, Marrai estate road, Mookkuwatte road and Malimboda road. Most of
         the travelers use Hatton road which is via Nallatanniya to Adam’s Peak. The longest way is from 
         Rathnapura road and travelers have to hike over 18000 steps to reach the peak. Although it is hard
          to travel, you can have great experience if you hike through the Kuruvita, Erathna road.</p><br>
        
        Huge numbers of local and foreign visitors reach the Adam’s peak every year. They can enjoy the beauty of the environment which can be seen from the top of Adam’s peak. If you are lucky enough to b on top of “ira Sevaya”which is the silhouette of the peak falling on the opposite. All in all, Adam’s peak is the best place to see the sunrise and sunset in Sri Lanka.
